# Project OverView:
  
In this Project we'll complete the full process of machine learning project.This includes creating hypothesis, setting up the model, and measuring the error. we will use the data from historical Olympics games and we will try to predict how many medals a country will win based on the current and historical data.
  
# Machine learning project steps:

Project steps:
1.Form a hypothesis
2.Find and explore the data
3.Reshape the data if necessary to predict your Target
4.Clean the data for ML.
5.Pick an error metric.
6.Split your data.
7.Train a model.

# Libraries used:

1. Pandas.
2. Numpy.
3. Matplotlib.
4. seaborn.

# Data

I have used the Hotel Reservation dataset, which was originally on Kaggle.
